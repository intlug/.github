# About Us

The International Linux Users Group is an experiment to do what local Linux Users Groups have done for decades, but on an international scale. Meetings are online only and we work on making an environment where sharing and learning is easy and inviting.  This is a group for Linux users - regardless of distribution and experience levels. We'll try to find topics that pleases a wide range of interests and levels. And best of all, we're just startng - to keep an eye out for this space for updates, join the meetup (https://meetup.com/intlug) to participate in our meetings.
